Multiprotocol Label Switching () is a routing technique in telecommunications networks that directs data from one node to the next based on labels rather than network addresses.[1] Whereas network addresses identify endpoints, the labels identify established paths between endpoints. MPLS can encapsulate packets of various network protocols, hence the multiprotocol component of the name. MPLS supports a range of access technologies, including T1/E1, ATM, Frame Relay, and DSL.
