A number of different technologies were previously deployed with essentially identical goals, such 
as Frame Relay and ATM. Frame Relay and ATM use labels to move frames or cells through a 
network. The header of the Frame Relay frame and the ATM cell refers to the virtual 
circuit that the frame or cell resides on. The similarity between Frame Relay, ATM,
 and MPLS is that at each hop throughout the network, the label value in the header 
 is changed. This is different from the forwarding of IP packets.[2] MPLS technologies have
  evolved with the strengths and weaknesses of ATM in mind. MPLS is designed to have 
  lower overhead than ATM while providing connection-oriented services for variable-length frames,
   and has replaced much use of ATM in the market.[3] MPLS dispenses with the cell-switching and
    signaling-protocol baggage of ATM. MPLS recognizes that small ATM cells are not needed 
    in the core of modern networks, since modern optical networks are fast enough that even 
    full-length 1500-byte packets do not incur significant real-time queuing delays.[a] At the same time, MPLS attempts to preserve the traffic engineering (TE) and out-of-band control that\
 made Frame Relay and ATM attractive for deploying large-scale networks

Label: 20 bits
A label with the value of 1 represents the router alert label.
Traffic Class (TC): 3 bits
Field for QoS (quality of service) priority and ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification). Prior to 2009 this field was called EXP.[12]
Bottom of Stack (S): 1 bit
If this flag is set, it signifies that the current label is the last in the stack.
Time to Live (TTL): 8 bits
Time to live.
These MPLS-labeled packets are switched based on the label instead of a lookup in the IP routing table. When MPLS was conceived, label switching was faster than a routing table lookup because switching could take place directly within the switched fabric and avoided CPU and software involvement.

The presence of such a label has to be indicated to the switch. In the case of Ethernet frames this is done through the use of EtherType values 0x8847 and 0x8848, for unicast and multicast connections respectively.[13]

In an MPLS network, labels are assigned to data packets. Packet-forwarding decisions are made solely on the contents of this label, without the need to examine the packet itself. This allows one to create end-to-end circuits across any type of transport medium, using any protocol. The primary benefit is to eliminate dependence on a particular OSI model data link layer (layer 2) technology, and eliminate the need for multiple layer-2 networks to satisfy different types of traffic. Multiprotocol label switching belongs to the family of packet-switched networks.

MPLS operates at a layer that is generally considered to lie between traditional definitions of OSI Layer 2 (data link layer) and Layer 3 (network layer), and thus is often referred to as a layer 2.5 protocol. It was designed to provide a unified data-carrying service for both circuit-based clients and packet-switching clients which provide a datagram service model. It can be used to carry many different kinds of traffic, including IP packets, as well as native Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Frame Relay, Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) or Ethernet.

Multiprotocol Label Switching () is a routing technique in telecommunications networks that directs data from one node to the next based on labels rather than network addresses.[1] Whereas network addresses identify endpoints, the labels identify established paths between endpoints. MPLS can encapsulate packets of various network protocols, hence the multiprotocol component of the name. MPLS supports a range of access technologies, including T1/E1, ATM, Frame Relay, and DSL.
