A number of different technologies were previously deployed with essentially identical goals, such 
as Frame Relay and ATM. Frame Relay and ATM use labels to move frames or cells through a 
network. The header of the Frame Relay frame and the ATM cell refers to the virtual 
circuit that the frame or cell resides on. The similarity between Frame Relay, ATM,
 and MPLS is that at each hop throughout the network, the label value in the header 
 is changed. This is different from the forwarding of IP packets.[2] MPLS technologies have
  evolved with the strengths and weaknesses of ATM in mind. MPLS is designed to have 
  lower overhead than ATM while providing connection-oriented services for variable-length frames,
   and has replaced much use of ATM in the market.[3] MPLS dispenses with the cell-switching and
    signaling-protocol baggage of ATM. MPLS recognizes that small ATM cells are not needed 
    in the core of modern networks, since modern optical networks are fast enough that even 
    full-length 1500-byte packets do not incur significant real-time queuing delays.[a] At the same time, MPLS attempts to preserve the traffic engineering (TE) and out-of-band control that\
 made Frame Relay and ATM attractive for deploying large-scale networks
